# **xmlpak â€“ a road to vendor apps**
## Description
This module enables you to download and install vendor apps from Google Play. Their compatibility is not guaranteed.

What vendors are supported?
HTC, OnePlus, Essential, Asus, Nokia/HMD Global, Google (lens, dialer, launcher, Daydream, maybe something else), Motorola, BlackBerry, Nextbit, BQ, Sony, Samsung, Cyanogen, Razer, NVIDIA, Acer.
## Changelog
2.6: initial version for repo
2.7: few xmls updated, what else?
## Requirements
- possibly none
## Instructions
After reboot, wait. Or not. Play Store often isn't too hasty in terms of compatibility detection. If you want to be quicker and don't want to say something about not working module, reset Play Store and Play Store Services data + reboot again. And if you are somehow on Marshmallow, you may even need to wipe the whole data.
